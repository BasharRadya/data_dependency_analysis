implement an algorithm for analyzing data dependencies in a given program
The tool receives processor characteristics and execution traces as input. 
It allows querying dependencies between instructions, such
as "Which instructions does a specific instruction depend on?"
This helps in understanding instruction parallelism and optimizing
resource allocation in microarchitecture design.
